                    SKILLUP isnâ€™t just any learning platform â€“ itâ€™s your brainâ€™s personal training arena.
                    Here, you learn programming step by step with theory, exercises, and levels that feel more like a game than a lesson.
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    Every level you complete unlocks certificates (just like achievements in a game â€“ but with a bit more LinkedIn credibility than Xbox points).
                </p>
                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
                    In short: youâ€™ll get smarter, have fun, and maybe even get a little hooked â€“ but in the best way possible. ðŸš€
